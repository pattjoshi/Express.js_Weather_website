# [What is process.env.PORT in Node.js?] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18864677/what-is-process-env-port-in-node-js)

- In many environments (e.g. Heroku), and as a convention, you can set the environment variable PORT to tell your web server what port to listen on.
- So process.env.PORT || 8000 means: whatever is in the environment variable PORT, or 8000 if there's nothing there.

```
const port = process.env.PORT || 8000;
```
